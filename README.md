Chokma! I'm a second year MA student in the American Indian Studies IDP. I did my undergrad in geography at Mcgill University, so I have a bit of experience w/ ArcGIS and ENVI, but no real coding experience! I study open pit mines and Native new media art. I'm interested in a final project related to climate or food justice, although I'm open to anything!
